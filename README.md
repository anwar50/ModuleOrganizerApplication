# My Application

This project is a simple RESTful API that organises the modules taken throughout my computer science
degree. It uses Node JS as the backend and React JS as the frontend. It incorporates both of these technologies
while using Loopback to build the API in which you can find the documentation here [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
